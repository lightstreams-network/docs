## What is Lightstreams?

Lightstreams brings the capability of storing assets (files) in conjunction with Blockchain technology in a efficient, low-priced and decentralized manner. The key innovation is an advanced permissioning system that lets content producers store and monetise their intellectual property (text, images, music, movies).

A new generation of internet applications (known as Decentralised Applications or DApps) can also be developed using this technology.
Lightstreams lets DApp developers store and manage access to files needed for their DApps that cannot be privately or cheaply be stored with other blockchains.

Lightstreams is a public blockchain. This means that is 100% open for anyone to connect without restrictions. However, unlike most public blockchains, files on Lightstreams are stored securely and privately and only distributed with permission on a peer-to-peer basis. Each content producer or DApp developer is able to share protected content quickly with granular control and access tracking. This ensures transparency and auditability of when, how, and by whom data was approved and transmitted between users.  DApp developers developing smart contracts on blockchain (including but not limited to Ethereum’s public blockchain) can seamlessly reference files stored on the Lightstreams network.

## Why build on Lightstreams?

1. __Real-world identities__
- Use people’s verified identity to build real-world applications.
2. __Distributed Secure Storage Network__ 
- Distributed secure storage is made available to applications to permit access to content in a decentralised environment. 
3. __Fast. Scalable__
- Get all the benefits from a decentralized infrastructure for distributing content without blockchain scaling issues.
4. __Trustless__
- Build decentralized marketplaces with peer-to-peer exchanges. 

## Why use DApps built on Lightstreams?

1. __Self-sovereign identity__
- Users control their identity. They decide who can see and use it. 
- Users control & manage their own data. Applications always need to request permissions to use it.
- No single point of failure for data breaches that can occur in traditional highly centralised internet services.

2. __Monetise content__
- Higher royalty earnings by digital content and intellectual property direct sales.
- Users earn income for curating discoverable content.
- Users can hold in tokens associated with content to benefit from appreciation in value.

3. __Decentralised network__
- Participation in a network that is not controlled by any one entity.
- Self-governance for an open, fair and stable network
- Each user's vote determines the direction of the network.

## Who needs Lighststreams?

- DApps that require high security for managing access to information. Data is protected through ensuring only the correct people (or businesses) can see the information (eg only your doctors or lawyer). Distributed sharing of data with authorised people eliminates any centralised point of weakness that can be breached.

- Consumers who want to control their data privacy by allowing them to be (monetarily) rewarded for sharing select information only to the companies they trust (and no one else)

- Those selling digital content (eg music/audio) with rights of ownership (and royalties for artists) automatically included.

- Business that require confidential legal documents to be digitally signed directly between parties without requiring an intermediary to facilitate execution.
