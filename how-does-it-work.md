title:  "How does it work?"
---

Lightstreams uses its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain for the transparent and auditable management of file-access permissions, and a separate enhanced IPFS protocol for encrypted file storage and peer-to-peer file distribution.  The Lightstreams blockchain is based on Ethereum but modified for shorter block times and also replaces the wasteful proof-of-work protocol with proof-of-authority.


## What does this enable?

Lightstreams allows content producers to monetise their intellectual property.  Content producers will be able to share files, images, music and movies and monetise them directly without needing a third party to host the content or broker the details - the smart contracts on the Lightstreams blockchain manage the payments and permissioning.

DApps that use Lightstreams will allow users to access content such as audio, video or images in a *fast* and *responsive* manner - currently not possible on Ethereum’s public blockchain.  We imagine two scenarios, one being DApps built on Ethereum referencing files on Lightstreams, and the other being DApps built directly on Lightstreams.  As Lightstreams’ blockchain is compatible with Ethereum, moving a DApp from Ethereum to Lightstreams is simple.

## What is an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)?

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol can be described as a standard to create a content-addressable peer-to-peer method of storing and retrieving data in a distributed file system. The content-addressing system guarantees that the data retrieved always matches the address used for finding the data. It is decentralised, meaning there is no dependency on any one computer or entity for hosting the data. Data is be replicated to multiple computers as it is shared, this add many layers of redundancy. In other words, every computer hosting a specific piece of data would need to be compromised to lose the data.

The hypermedia protocol also scales on demand - the more demand there is for a file, the more copies are made and so the faster the data transfer of that file becomes by virtue of the increased number of computers sharing files/content/data at the same time.

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a public, open-source blockchain-based computing platform. Its main feature is that of a Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for running modules of application code called smart contracts. A user may think of Ethereum as an operating system for running apps (like a smartphone that can run multiple apps). Ethereum is decentralised. The system or network is not run by one specific entity that owns the infrastructure.

Smart Contracts are used to enact business logic, essential for DApps on the Ethereum network. A smart contract is suitable for small data, they are not suitable for the storage and retrieval of media files.
