In order to facilitate the integration and usage of [Leth](/getting-started/quick-start)
Lightstreams team implemented a Javascript SDK which bridges the endpoints of the [Lightstreams Gateway HTTP api](https://docs.lightstreams.network/api-docs)
to a Node Express server

You can find the project repository [here](https://github.com/lightstreams-network/lightstreams-js-sdk)
