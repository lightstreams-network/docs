Using [`leth`](/getting-started/quick-start/) we implemented the following example projects:

- [e-commerce demo](/examples/e-commerce)
- [JS SDK](/examples/js-sdk)

Beside that, we could use **Leth** as fundamental pillar for many other decentralized applications (DApps), such as:

- Light Drive, a decentralized file synchronization tool
- Light Note, a decentralized note taking application
- Light Bookmark, a decentralized bookmarking and website archiving tool
