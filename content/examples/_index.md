Below we have proposed a list of decentralize applications(DApps) where
  [`leth`](/getting-started/quick-start/) could become an fundamental pillar
  for their implementation:

- LightDrive, a decentralized file synchronization tool
- LightNote, a decentralized note taking application
- LightBookmark, a decentralized bookmarking and archiving tool
