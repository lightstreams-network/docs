## Introduction

A Lightstreams node consists of the following pieces:

- `leth` is a command line interface used to run, interact, and control the Lightstreams node
- `geth`[1] is the the command line interface for running a full ethereum node implemented in Go
- `ipfs`[2] is a decentralised file system enhanced with our award winning “Permissioned Blocks” technology

In the next section, we will proceed to install everything required to run a complete Lightstreams node.
