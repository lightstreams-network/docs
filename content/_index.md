#  Welcome!

Hi there! Welcome to the Lightstreams documentation!

At **Lightstreams**, we believe the future is private and that no one company should own it #ownyourdata. We want to help you
make it happen. Lightstreams empowers developers and companies to create a future with decentralized applications (dApps), where
users are in control of their personal data.

## Why Lightstreams?
- Lightstreams has its own blockchain, a **PoA Ethereum compatible** blockchain.
- Lightstreams blockchain is **fast**, up to 200 transactions per second.
- Lightstreams is **GDPR compliant**, users control their data.
- Lightstreams is **politically decentralized**, we have a radical governance model.
- Lightstreams is for mainstream users, we enable **freemium models** for your Dapps.

## Our network

Lightstreams has implemented [`Lightchain`](https://github.com/lightstreams-network/lightchain) a 
Proof of Authority(PoA) Ethereum blockchain which is 100% compatible with the latest ethereum features. 
Lightstreams blockchain uses **Tendermint Byzantine fault tolerance(BFT)** protocol to achieve consensus on the
produced blocks.

Currently there are two available networks, a test network named **Sirius** and a main network. Both of them can be 
monitored using the corresponding block explorers [*explorer.sirius.lightstreams.io*](https://explorer.sirius.lightstreams.io)
and [*explorer.lightstreams.io*](https://explorer.lightstreams.io). Don't waste one more second and request some 
**FREE TOKENS** for our network `Sirius` now and go to code, just text us on our 
[*forum*](https://discuss.lightstreams.network/t/request-test-tokens/64/10) or in our [*telegram*](https://t.me/LightstreamsDevelopers).

## The Smart Vault

Our development team got to create an unique software by the seamless integration of three popular elements: Tendermint,
Ethereum and a IPFS protocol enhanced by our team with a *permissioned layer* to ensure 
user's content is ONLY distributed to authorized peers.

Using **Leth**, Lightstreams SDK for dApp developers, you can interact with the Smart Vault 
and share content in a distribute and secure manner in only few commands using its [*CLI*](/cli-docs/leth/) 
or in few lines of code using its [*HTTP API*](https://docs.lightstreams.network/api-docs/). 
 Read more about how to install it or use it in [Getting started](/getting-started/).
