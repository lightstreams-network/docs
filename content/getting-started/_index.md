## What is Lightstreams?

[Lightstreams](https://www.lightstreams.network) is a technology stack that enables users to share files &content in a secure and distributed manner. The stack is comprised of an Etheruem-based public blockchain layer with smart contract capabilities connected to an IPFS protocol layer for secure file management. If you are a dapp developer, you can use the [leth command line](/cli-docs/leth) to let users store files/content with smart contract authorization rules.
